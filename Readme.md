Capstone Project

Project Proposal : 
Topic :
On-Demand Service Platform for Connecting Customers with Service Agents.     
Objective : 
The objective of this project is to develop an on-demand service platform that connects customers requiring various services from service agents proficient in those areas, making the process smoother and more efficient.
Tech Stack : 

Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Frontend: React.js
Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose ODM)
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Communication: Email for asynchronous messaging
Mapping: Google Maps API for location-based services
Deployment: Render (Backend), Netlify (Frontend)

Description (Features in Detail):

Customer Authentication:

Customers can securely sign up and log in to the platform.
Authentication will be implemented using JWT for secure user sessions.

Service Agents Listing and Search:

Service Agents can create profiles showcasing their skills, experience, and availability.
Customers can search for agents based on location, availability, and specific service requirements.


Service Request:


Customers can submit service requests, specifying the type of work needed and preferred timeframes.
Service agents receive notifications of new service requests matching their skills and location.

Email Communication:

Customers and Service agents communicate via email.
Customers can compose messages within the platform, and service agents receive email notifications for new messages.
Service agents can reply directly via email, and messages are persisted within the platform.

Rating and Review System:

Upon service completion, customers can rate and review service agents.
Ratings and reviews contribute to the overall reputation of service agents within the platform.

Payment Integration:

Integration with a payment gateway to facilitate secure transactions between customers and service agents.
Customers can make payments directly through the platform after service completion.

Conclusion:

This project leverages the power of Node.js and Express.js for the backend and React.js for the frontend to create an efficient on-demand service platform. By utilising MongoDB for the database, JWT for authentication, email communication for messaging, and Google Maps API for mapping services, the platform aims to provide a seamless experience for users. With deployment on Render for the backend and Netlify for the frontend, the platform will be scalable, reliable, and easily accessible. Through this project, we aim to revolutionise the way customers(help-seekers) find service agents while ensuring transparency, reliability, and convenience throughout the process.



I created a repo for my project and added my readme file and put the data  into it.
